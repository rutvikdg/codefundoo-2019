Amidst the recent lok sabha election we got to know about forceful voting and proxy voting which are very serious issues as they compromise on the security and integrity of voters. Thus we decided to work on such issues. 
Forceful voting : This issues is mainly faced on the polling booths where the majority of voters are uneducated and belong to poor households. The voter is forcefully made to cast a particular vote by a person who is standing  beside the voter and ensuring that he/she cast’s the desirable vote ,thus violating the privacy of the voter. The voter in such cases is generally given money or given security threats.
Proxy voting : Every polling booth has a verification officer who verifies a person’s identity by a voter id card and confirms that the person has casted his vote in a voter’s list manually. So there is always a possibility that a vote can be casted without the consent of the voter (in case the voter is absent or forcefully is made to be absent or the person is dead and still on the voter’s list).
Solution : The above mentioned problems can be solved by introducing two new technologies to the existing system. First to prevent forceful voting we need to ensure the privacy of the voter which can be obtained by ensuring that there is no one with the voter while he is voting at the EVM station.
This can be done by image processing which will cover a certain area around the EVM machine and the thus ensure that there only one person i.e the voter. Proxy voting can be resolved by having a biometric system which will be kept next to the EVM machine. Since aadhar card has the biometric database of every citizen with all kinds of verified details of a person, the biometric machine will use this database to identify the person and will check his name in the voter’s list. Once both the signals i.e there is only one person and verified voter are true the EVM machine will accept the vote. In all  other cases the EVM will be in standby mode and will not accept the vote.
Positive outcomes : 
1)	Both capturing will come to end.
2)	Forceful voting will not be possible.
3)	Proxy voting will be eliminated.
4)	There is no need of a verification officer.
5)	There is no need of ink to be applied on voter’s finger.
6)	There is no need of a separate person who applies ink on the finger of voter.
7)	Now people will be able vote with full privacy without any fear.
